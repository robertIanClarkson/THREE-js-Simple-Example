# THREE-js-Simple-Example

A simple cube object in a css container with sliders for x, y, z axis.

Code is well commented and is a good place to start when learning THREEjs.

It took me a few hours to get this far because I have never done anything with 3D models. I figured I would share it to help someone else!

Hope this helps you!
